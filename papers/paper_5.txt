After purchasing rights to Steig's book in 1991,
Steven Spielberg sought to produce a traditionally-animated film adaptation, but John H. Williams
convinced him to bring the project to the newly founded DreamWorks in 1994. Jeffrey Katzenberg, along with
Williams and Aron Warner, began development on Shrek in 1995, immediately following the studio's purchase of the rights
from Spielberg. Chris Farley was cast as the voice for the title character, recording most of the required dialogue,
but died in 1997 before his work on the film was finished; Myers was hired to replace him, and gave Shrek
his Scottish accent. The film was initially intended to be created using motion capture, but after poor test
results, the studio hired Pacific Data Images to complete the final computer animation. Shrek parodies
other fairy tale adaptations, primarily animated Disney films.
