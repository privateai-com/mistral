Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common life-limiting recessive genetic disorders 
in Caucasians, caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator (CFTR). CF is a multi-organ disease that involves the lungs, pancreas, sweat glands, 
digestive and reproductive systems and several other tissues. This debilitating condition is 
associated with recurrent lower respiratory tract bacterial and viral infections, as well 
as inflammatory complications that may eventually lead to pulmonary failure. Immune cells 
play a crucial role in protecting the organs against opportunistic infections and also in 
the regulation of tissue homeostasis. Innate immune cells are generally affected by CFTR 
mutations in patients with CF, leading to dysregulation of several cellular signalling pathways 
that are in continuous use by these cells to elicit a proper immune response. There is 
substantial evidence to show that airway epithelial cells, neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages 
all contribute to the pathogenesis of CF, underlying the importance of the CFTR in 
innate immune responses. The goal of this review is to put into context the important 
role of the CFTR in different innate immune cells and how CFTR dysfunction contributes 
to the pathogenesis of CF, highlighting several signalling pathways that may be dysregulated in 
cells with CFTR mutations.
