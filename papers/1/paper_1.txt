Accumulation of MDSCs associated with tumor growth could be because of various mechanisms, 
including the presence of excessive growth factors, cytokines, or inflammatory molecules 
that provide continuous survival signals; absence of signals that normally induce cell death; 
or nonresponsiveness of MDSCs to death signals. We have conducted a mass spectrometry screen 
of MDSCs and observed expression of multiple proteins associated with the Fas-FasL (Fas ligand) 
apoptosis pathway. Therefore, we have explored the role of this pathway in the survival 
and accumulation of MDSCs. We now report that MDSCs express the death receptor 
Fas and are killed when Fas is engaged by FasL. Activated T cells expressing FasL 
mediate apoptosis of MDSCs in vivo, suggesting that Fas-FasL interactions may regulate MDSC homeostasis 
and that Fas-FasL interactions could be exploited as a strategy to reduce MDSC levels in vivo.
