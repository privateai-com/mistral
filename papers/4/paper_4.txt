Within a nervous system, a neuron, neurone, or nerve cell is an electrically excitable 
cell that fires electric signals called action potentials across a neural network. 
Neurons communicate with other cells via synapses, which are specialized connections that 
commonly use minute amounts of chemical neurotransmitters to pass the electric signal 
from the presynaptic neuron to the target cell through the synaptic gap.
The neuron is the main component of nervous tissue in all animals except sponges and 
placozoa. Non-animals like plants and fungi do not have nerve cells. Molecular evidence 
suggests that the ability to generate electric signals first appeared in evolution some 700 to 800 
million years ago, during the Tonian period. Predecessors of neurons were the peptidergic 
secretory cells. They eventually gained new gene modules which enabled cells to create 
post-synaptic scaffolds and ion channels that generate fast electrical signals. The ability to 
generate electric signals was a key innovation in the evolution of the nervous system.
